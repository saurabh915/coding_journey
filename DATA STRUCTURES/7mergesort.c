/*the overall process here is first break down whole array into  peaces of two elements
and then make one as low and one as high and one as mid  and start comparing low sided elements with mid+1 sided elements 
 if first element of low sided element is smaller than first element which are on mid+1 side then move it on new array 
 then as element of smaller side is added to new array only low side is incremented and again checked with first elements of 
 mid+1 side when elements on low side found to be greater than element on low side then mid+1 sided element is stored in new array
 and that sided element is compared with all low sided elements and if all elements of one side are stored on new array 
 then remaing elements of remaining side are stored as they are and this process continued till top branch*/
